# Cronic HTML
A cure for Cron's chronic email problem.

ðŸ¤’ The Disease:
```bash
0 1 * * * backup >/dev/null 2>&1
```

ðŸ’Š The Cure:
```bash
0 1 * * * cronic-html backup
```

This project is is fork of [cronic](https://habilis.net/cronic/) and includes some new features.

## What can I do with Cronic HTML?

You can create cron jobs that run your script, and make sure that you are notified when they fail.

The received email will contain:
  * The failed command
  * The return code
  * The standard output (stdout), so you get a context of the error
  * The standard error (stderr), so you get a context of the error
  * Any debug trace. Output when the script has `set -x` in it

You will never find yourself redirecting the output to `/dev/null` ðŸ˜Ž

## What advantages has Cronic HTML over Cronic
Cronic is a great and simple script, and does his work very well, however due to this simplicity, it cannot handle colors.

Cronic HTML allows your script to output ANSI colors ðŸŒˆ

Using ANSI colors in your script will make easier to read the logs and understand why a cron script has failed.
Why doing black and white when we can do colors?


## Templates
Cronic HTML includes a basic template system.

Templates:
* Allow to customize the output from cron execution scripts.
* Are a plain bash script that has some output. 
* Are sourced in the cronic-html script
* Receive some environment variables with the result of the script executed by `cronic-html`
* Must print in the standard output (stdout)


## Template Parameters
The environment variables available for the template are:

| Parameter      | Required | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COMMAND`      |   Yes    | Command executed by cronic. Your script. i.e. `/opt/backup/your-backup --color -v`       |
| `RESULT`       |   Yes    | Exit code from the script. i.e. `133`                                                    |
| `OUT_CONTENT`  |   Yes    | Output of the script (stdout) i.e. `Starting backup...`                                  |
| `ERR_CONTENT`  |   Yes    | Output of the script (stderr) i.e. `No such file or directory: /home/foo`                |
| `TRACE_CONTENT`|   No     | Trace/debug output of the script (when the script runs in debug mode, with `set -x`) i.e. `+ echo Debug` |
| `NL`           |   Yes    | Command executed by cronic. Your script. i.e. `+ echo Debug`                             |

# Config
Cronic HTML allows to optionally define your own configuration. The configuration can be used for selecting another 
template or create your own.

`cronic-html` will read the following files (in order of precedence):
* `~/.cronic-html.conf`
* `/etc/cronic-html/cronic-html.conf`

The config files will be sourced, so they can re-define the following variables:

| Variable         | Required | Default value                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TEMPLATE_FILE`  |   No     | `/etc/cronic-html/templates/html.tmpl.sh`                                               |


For example:

```bash
TEMPLATE_FILE=/etc/cronic-html/templates/color.html.sh
```
