# Cron job report wrapper with template support
#
# Templates:
#     - Allow to customize the output from cron execution scripts
#     - Templates are a plain bash script that has some output. 
#     - Templates are sourced in the cronic-html script, if there was any errors in it execution
#     - Templates receive some environment variables with the result of the script executed by cronic-html
#     - Templates must print in the standard output (stdout)
#
# Environment variables received by the template:
#     - COMMAND: Required. Command executed by cronic
#     - RESULT:  Required. Exit code from the script
#     - OUT_CONTENT: Required, although might be empty. Output of the script (stdout)
#     - ERR_CONTENT: Required, although might be empty. Output of the script (stderr)
#     - TRACE_CONTENT: Optional, may be undefined. Trace/debug output of the script (when the script runs in debug mode, with "set -x")
#     - NL: New Line character
#
# Sample templates:
#     - Plain template (templates/plain.tmpl.sh): Basic template, outputs the same content as the original "cronic".
#     - Html template (templates/html.tmpl.sh): Default template. Prints an HTML email with the result of the script. 
#       One nice feature of this template is that it will preserve the ANSI colors from the output of the script.
#

# Plain text template: 
#   Outputs the text that original cronic script writes
